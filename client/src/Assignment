The ReactJS application should be able to:
- Retrieve data via a HTTP GET-request from the NodeJS server.
- Post data via a HTTP POST-request to the NodeJS server.
- Display retrieved data using ReactJS component(s).
- Provide a way to submit data using ReactJS component(s).
The NodeJS server should be able to:
- Provide necessary HTTP routes.
- Serve and communicate with the attached JSON file.
- (Optional) Serve the ReactJS application build.
This assignment only requires you to implement a GET and POST request. However
you are free to add more endpoints.
Once youâ€™re done upload the code to a public git repository and send us the link.
